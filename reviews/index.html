It can make you cry, laugh, and think, and you will never at any point be able to predict which emotion is invoked next. A balance is nonetheless masterfully found through the combination of a multifaceted story with masterful songwriting."</b>

        <p><font face="EB Garamond" size="4" color="#fff">"This show was superb - the music itself was composed in an exceptional way to match the theme of the early 19th century whilst maintaining the modern aspects that draw and keep a listeners attention, performed by a phenomenal group of musicians. The acting both between and during the musical numbers was gripping, showcasing the important historical characteristics of each of the writers themselves, as well as the relationships between them. Each of the performers showcased powerhouse vocals that shone through the performance space, displaying each of their character's thoughts and troubles with seeming ease. Overall, everyone involved in this production did a fantastic job, and congratulations must be passed on to both the director and the writers for producing a piece of student theatre of such a high calibre."

The actors understood their characters very well and portrayed their wit as well as their insecurities with precision and passion. The music was amazing, the cast’s voices fit very well together and the lyrics were clever and thoughtful. The costumes, lighting and stage design were simple and effective in immersing the audience in the characters’ world. Beyond being an impressive production from a very talented team of students, this musical does the very important job of nurturing one’s curiosity — about the Romantics, literature at large or, as the characters remind us, why we create."
